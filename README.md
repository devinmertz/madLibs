# madLibs

Angular JS project to show a single input on the user interface where you can enter a series of ten words.
The program will cycle through the different words that will be added to the mad lib each time the user clicks the submit button.
Once the ten words have been entered, the entire mad lib phrase will appear with each of the ten words in their correct position within the phrase.
